# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

This page is a refactoring of a Marketing Agency website in order to improve web accessiblity. Web accessibility helps people with disabilities to access websites using assistive technologies and is an increasingly important consideration for this project. The final product will improve accessibility for people using screen readers by including descriptive title and alt attributes and using semantic html elements that follow a logical order. 

### What I learned
I learned where and when to use different semantic elements and how to write desciptive alt attributes. Through this process I also learned to consolidate css elements in order to more concise code.

## Usage

The website can be found at [this link](https://carol-tsai.github.io/horiseon-accessibility-refactor/).

You can navigate to different sections of this page using the links on the top right corner. People using a screen reader will be able to hear a descriptive title and alt attributes for the images and icons on the website.
